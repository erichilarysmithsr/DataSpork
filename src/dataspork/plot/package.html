Plotting classes for the dataspork packages.
This package is built on the Java2D graphics classes.
The classes are divided into three types:
<ol>
<li>The <code>PlotPanel</code> class holds the plot.</li>
<li>PlotElements</li> are any objects that make up the plot,
such as axes, xy-functions, and data labels.  Also, this is a base class
of <code>PlotBox</code>, described next.
<li><code>PlotBox</code> and the <code>Plot</code> subclass are special
<code>PlotElements</code> that are containers.  These form the tree nodes, and
<code>Plot</code> forms the base of the tree, which fits into the 
<code>PlotPanel</code>
</ol>
</p><p>
In addition to these classes, there is a class <code>CoordSys</code>
which serves to represent a local coordinate system, defined by
an affine tranformation and a coordinate range.
