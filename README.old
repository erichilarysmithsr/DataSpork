This file assumes that the program DataSpork is in the directory
/afs/ncsa.uiuc.edu/projects/qmc2/DataSpork.  

To use DataSpork on modi4, you need to do the following:

1.  Put java 1.2 in your path.  On modi4, this would be:

set path=(/usr/local/java1.2/usr/java/bin $path)  # defaults to new java 1.2 now

(make sure that the java 1.2 directory is first, to supercede any java's
that may be in /usr/local/bin or whatever.)

2.  Set your CLASSPATH to include the dataspork files:

setenv CLASSPATH 
/afs/ncsa/projects/qmc2/DataSpork:/afs/ncsa/projects/qmc2/DataSpork/xml-tr2/xml.jar:.

(This should all be one line, with no spaces.) 

3.  Set the following environment variable:

setenv LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH /afs/ncsa/projects/qmc2/java/native/IRIX-n32:/opt/mpt/mpt/usr/lib32/mips4:/opt/mpt/mpt/usr/lib32:/opt/MIPSpro/MIPSpro/usr/lib32/mips4:/opt/MIPSpro/MIPSpro/usr/lib32

(Again, this should all be on one line, with no spaces between the
directories.)  

To run, type 
  java dataspork.Main
